# Git-ModTEST
The test of a minecraft mod

This Minecraft mod is still a WIP of me learning JAVA to later make mods and other things (probably).
You should probably check my twitter since i'm probably gonna post updates there : @Cacofiin.
You can also modify the mod as you will since it is in no case a REAL mod that will make it onto curse forge.

The files will later be brought in.
If you want to help me with this mod you can also contact me on Twitter, here on Github or even on Discord if you know me.
The mod will probably get developped on livestreams too so that you can see my non-skill.

This mod is for version 1.16.4 only.
